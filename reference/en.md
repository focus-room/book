New Book Framework Concept: Focus Room: The Agile Focus Method to Unleash Team Potential
Book Framework Example:
Foreword: Why Do We Need the Focus Room?
	• The Paradox of Collaboration: More Tools, More Distractions?
	• The Story of an Autonomous Driving Project: PhantomDrive's "Focus Hub" Miracle
	• The Core Promise of the Focus Room: Less Time, Higher Output, Happier Teams
Part One: Understanding the Value of Chaos and Focus (Concepts and Vision)
	• Chapter 1: The Cost of Distraction: The Hidden Costs of Modern Work
		○ The Myth of Multitasking and the Penalty of Cognitive Switching
		○ Communication "Noise" vs. "Signal"

	• Chapter 2: The Power of Focus: Individual, Team, and the "Presence of Others" Effect
		○ Flow State: The Peak of Individual Efficiency
		○ Productive Work Rhythms: Segmenting Tasks, Protecting Focus (Briefly mentioning the Pomodoro Technique as a foundation)
		○ Unveiling the "Social Facilitation Effect": Why Performance Changes with Others Present
			§ Theoretical Introduction: What is the Social Facilitation Effect? (Enhances simple tasks, may inhibit complex tasks)
			§ How the Focus Room Cleverly Leverages It:
				□ Creating a Positive "Sense of Presence": How virtual rooms simulate a real co-working atmosphere, inspiring motivation to complete tasks. (Shared goals and visible effort, such as focused periods recorded by online tools, can also stimulate a moderate "sense of being observed," thereby enhancing motivation for planned tasks.)
				□ Shared "Sense of Ritual": Such as the synchronized start of "Focus Blocks," daily stand-ups, enhancing a sense of belonging and collective motivation.
				□ Avoiding Negative Impacts: Ensuring individuals are not directly disturbed or overly evaluated during complex thinking tasks through clear "Focus Blocks" and "Room Rules." The emphasis is on "co-focused presence" rather than "supervised work."
		○ Team Focus: The Possibility of Collective Flow
	• Chapter 3: Focus Room Core Principles: Five Disciplines to Unleash Potential (Original: "Focus Room Core Principles: Agile, Focused, Iterative")
		○ Principle One: Single Goal, Maximum Sprint
		○ Principle Two: Protected Space, Minimized Distractions
		○ Principle Three: Streamlined Communication, Rapid Decision-Making
		○ Principle Four: Focus Block Rhythm Method, Maintaining High-Efficiency Pace (Achieved by setting "Focus Blocks")
		○ Principle Five: Regular Retrospectives, Continuous Improvement
Part Two: Building Your First Focus Room (Methods and Practices)
	• Chapter 4: Launching Your Focus Room: Preparation and Planning (Build - Preparation Phase)
		○ Defining Sprint Goals: Applying SMART Principles
		○ Assembling the Sprint Team: Key Roles and Size (Consideration: How does team composition affect the manifestation of the social facilitation effect?)
		○ Physical Space vs. Virtual Space: Introducing the "Focus Room Online" Tool (Discussing how virtual environments create "social presence")
		○ Setting "Room Rules": Work hours, communication discipline, agreed-upon focus periods, disturbance handling mechanisms
	• Chapter 5: The Engine of the Focus Room: Empowering Teams with "Focus Blocks" (Measure - Process Management)
		○ Defining and Practicing "Focus Blocks": Setting Reasonable Focused Work Durations
		○ "Focus Room Online" Tool in Action: How to record effective focus duration and the number of completed Focus Blocks (How the tool reflects and enhances the positive aspects of social facilitation, e.g., progress sharing, virtual companionship)
		○ Strategic Breaks: Short Intervals and Phased Rests to Maintain Team Stamina [This section is tentative, not an essential process]
		○ Daily Stand-ups and Progress Visualization: Making Progress Clear at a Glance (Reinforcing the visibility of common goals and collective effort)
	• Chapter 6: Overcoming Obstacles: Conflict Management and Retrospectives in the Focus Room (Learn - Improvement Mechanism)
		○ Regular Retrospective Meetings: Identifying Bottlenecks, Collecting Feedback
		○ Centralized Conflict Resolution: Turning "Roadblocks" into "Stepping Stones"
		○ Applying The Lean Startup's "Build-Measure-Learn" Cycle in the Focus Room
		○ How to Use the "Focus Room Online" Tool to Assist Retrospectives and Conflict Tracking
	• Chapter 7: Measuring the Effectiveness of the Focus Room (Validated Learning)
		○ Quantitative Metrics: Task completion rate, cycle time, Focus Block completion efficiency
		○ Qualitative Metrics: Team morale, satisfaction, communication smoothness (Does the social facilitation effect bring positive changes to the team atmosphere?)
		○ A/B Testing: Comparing the Focus Room with Traditional Work Modes
Part Three: Expanding and Deepening: Integrating the Focus Room into Organizational DNA (Acceleration and Culture)
	• Chapter 8: Applicable Scenarios and Variations of the Focus Room

		○ Focus Room Practices for Teams of Different Sizes
	• Chapter 9: "Focus Room Online" Tool In-Depth Guide
		○ Detailed Feature Explanation: Virtual rooms, invitation mechanism, focus timer, task board, conflict zone, retrospective reports (How tool design reflects social psychology principles, e.g., creating a sense of a virtual "co-working space")
		○ Best Practices: How to Maximize Tool Effectiveness
		○ Future Outlook: AI-Assisted Focus Room
	• Chapter 10: Overcoming Implementation Resistance and Cultivating a Focus Culture
