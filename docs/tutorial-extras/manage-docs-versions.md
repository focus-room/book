## Building Your Own Focus-Room Technology

```javascript
// Example of a simple Focus-Room timer in JavaScript
class FocusRoomTimer {
  constructor(focusDuration, shortBreakDuration, longBreakDuration) {
    this.focusDuration = focusDuration * 60; // convert to seconds
    this.shortBreakDuration = shortBreakDuration * 60;
    this.longBreakDuration = longBreakDuration * 60;
    this.currentSession = 0;
    this.isRunning = false;
    this.timeRemaining = this.focusDuration;
    this.mode = 'focus';
  }

  start() {
    this.isRunning = true;
    this.timer = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  tick() {
    if (this.timeRemaining <= 0) {
      this.switchMode();
    } else {
      this.timeRemaining--;
    }
  }

  switchMode() {
    if (this.mode === 'focus') {
      this.currentSession++;
      this.mode = this.currentSession % 4 === 0 ? 'longBreak' : 'shortBreak';
      this.timeRemaining = this.currentSession % 4 === 0 ? 
        this.longBreakDuration : this.shortBreakDuration;
    } else {
      this.mode = 'focus';
      this.timeRemaining = this.focusDuration;
    }
  }
}
```

## Choosing the Right Technology

When selecting technology for your Focus-Room, consider:

1. **Simplicity**: Tools should enhance, not distract from, the core experience
2. **Reliability**: Technology failures can disrupt the entire session
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure tools work for all participants
4. **Flexibility**: Different contexts may require different technological approaches
5. **Cost**: Balance effectiveness with budget constraints

The most effective Focus-Room technology often combines low-tech approaches (like physical timer boards) with thoughtfully selected digital tools that enhance rather than replace the human elements of Focus-Room.
