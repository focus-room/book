# Focus-Room Principles and Rules

Effective Focus-Room sessions require clear guidelines and shared understanding among participants.

## Core Principles

1. **Shared Commitment**: Everyone agrees to fully engage during focus periods
2. **Mutual Respect**: Minimize disruptions to others' concentration
3. **Rhythmic Work**: Alternating between focused work and deliberate breaks
4. **Collective Energy**: Drawing motivation from the group's shared focus

## Standard Rules for Focus-Room

### During Focus Periods

- **No conversations**: Maintain complete silence
- **Devices on silent**: No notifications or sounds
- **Stay in your space**: Minimize movement
- **No multitasking**: Focus on a single task
- **No interruptions**: If someone needs to leave, they should do so quietly

### During Break Periods

- **Social interaction permitted**: Conversation is encouraged but optional
- **Movement encouraged**: Stand up, stretch, walk around
- **Step outside if needed**: For phone calls or louder conversations
- **Respect those who continue working**: Some may choose to work through breaks

## Time Structure Recommendations

A typical Focus-Room session follows the Pomodoro technique with modifications:

| Period | Duration | Activity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Focus | 25 minutes | Deep work |
| Short break | 5 minutes | Rest, stretch |
| Focus | 25 minutes | Deep work |
| Short break | 5 minutes | Rest, stretch |
| Focus | 25 minutes | Deep work |
| Long break | 15 minutes | Refresh, socialize |
| Focus | 25 minutes | Deep work |
| Closing | 5 minutes | Session reflection |

These guidelines can be adapted to your group's specific needs and preferences.
